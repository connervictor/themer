# Themer
Themer is a project I've created for generating my color themes. It turns
*yaml* templates into syntax files.

## Requirements
- node
- npm
- yarn

## Setup
Open up a terminal and type `yarn` to install the projects dependencies. To
render the syntax files execute `yarn render`.

It will output syntax files for *vim* and *lightline*. The theme is called
*creativecreature*.
