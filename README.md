# Themer
Themer is a project I've created for generating coherent color themes across
different applications.


## Requirements
- node
- npm
- yarn


## Setup
Open up a terminal and type `yarn` to install the projects dependencies. To
generate the themes execute `yarn render`.

Themer will output files for *VIM*, *Lightline* and *TMUX*. The VIM theme is called
*creativecreature*.
